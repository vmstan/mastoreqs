## Additional Resources

- [Installing from Source](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/install/) (docs.joinmastodon.org)
- [Mastodon Releases](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases) (github.com/mastodon/mastodon)

### Ruby Versions

Mastodon will have a file called `.ruby-version` in the source code that is the expected target version for that release.
For example, this file has `3.0.6` for the Mastodon 4.1.x branch.

It is best practice to run the specific target version in this file.
Administrators who require a different version will need to manually change the contents of `.ruby-version` to match.

It is not best practice to use the version of Ruby that is available in your OS platform repositories.
You should use a tool like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io) to install and manage the target Ruby version.
The Mastodon instructions for installing from source use rbenv.

### Node Versions

It is not best practice to use the version of Ruby that is available in your OS platform default repositories.
[NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) is a great option that support Debian, Ubuntu, and Redhat derivatives.
This allows you to select a target major version and keep up to date with the latest patches in that version.

### Full Text Search

Administrators can use either Elasticsearch or OpenSearch as targets for full text search indexing.

- [Installing Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/install-elasticsearch.html)
- [Installing OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/)
- [Configuring Full Text Search](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/elasticsearch/)

### ImageMagick Versions

All Mastodon installs should be using at least ImageMagick 6.9.7-7 to mitigate CVE-2023-36460, see [this guide](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/25776) for more details.

Use of GraphicsMagick as an alternative, is not supported.

### Product Lifecycles

For the purposes of this document, when applied to dependencies the term "End of Life" is standardized to mean when there are no further updates of any kind, and/or no support available for a released version of Mastodon or it's dependencies.

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/about/releases/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)
- [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/releases.html#maintenance-policy)

### Nginx or Other Ingress

Mastodon requires an load balancer or reverse proxy to properly terminate TLS/SSL connections between users and ingress traffic to the system.
Nginx is commonly used for this purpose, and [an example configuration](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/dist/nginx.conf) is provided in the Mastodon respository.

Other types of software can be used in place of Nginx, such as Caddy for example.
There is no Mastodon specific requirement that Nginx be used.

Reguardless of the ingress software that is used, you should keep it up to date to prevent expliotation of known CVEs.

- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)
